# UA-Finger
Underactuated Finger with gears

This is a simple Sketch I made from the Idea of this paper.

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7557077

As I don't have a 3D-Printer i could test my design.
You need to drill hole in the gear,wich has the springpart to tie a rubberband arround it(so you dont need flexible filament)

Things legt to do:
-drill holes for rubberband
-put in the Rubberband
-and you may need to scale it down by 5x or any wished number for matching sticks to pur through the holes

If someone has printed it and made adaptions for the Design he is welcome to Share them with me.

# UA-Finger
Underactuated Finger with gears

This is a simple Sketch I made from the Idea of this paper.

As I don't have a 3D-Printer i could test my design.
You need to drill hole in the gear,wich has the springpart to tie a rubberband arround it(so you dont need flexible filament)

If someone has printed it and made adaptions for the Design he is welcome to Share them with me.
